## Use seatbelt checker
In order to be able to use the seat belt check you need to make some changes. By default, qb-hud doesn't export any function to check this, it's up to you to add it like this:

- Add to qb-hud\client.lua:
```lua
local function checkseatbelt()
	return seatbeltOn
end

exports('checkseatbelt', checkseatbelt)
```
- Change the qb-driverschool/client/cl_customise.lua:
```lua
function  Checkseatbelt()
	if not Config.seatbelt  then  return  true  end
	return  exports['qb-hud']:checkseatbelt()
end
```
If you use another script to manage the belts, you will have to check if an export exists and replace the `exports['cd_carhud']:checkseatbelt()` with this other exported function
